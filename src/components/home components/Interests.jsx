          <p>
            Apart from being a web developer, I'm passionate about continuously
            expanding my knowledge and skills. I enjoy exploring a wide range of
            topics through movies, TV shows, books, and other forms of media.
            This curiosity fuels both my personal growth and professional
            development.

            When I'm not immersed in technology or learning new things, I value
            spending time with friends in cozy, intimate settings. As an
            introvert, I appreciate the quieter moments and meaningful
            connections that come from these smaller gatherings.
